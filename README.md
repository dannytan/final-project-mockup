## Start A Club Page
<p>The start a club page allows users to propose their own idea for a club. It could be an existing organization that is not at UH Manoa, or it can be an entirely new club. Once the proposal is submitted, it will be posted on a page with other proposals. On this page, other users will be able to respond to the club proposals and join in if they please.</p>

## Admin Home Page
<p>Here is a rough mockup of what the admin home page would look like. All that was added was a button to add a club, along with buttons below each club allowing the admin to delete an existing club.</p>
